abstract = "The putative associations between creative adaptability and the experience of emotional well-being (i.e., a positivity ratio of more positive than negative emotions) was investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak with a sample of 1,432 adults from four countries: Israel (n = 310), United States (n = 312), Italy (n = 378), and China (n = 569). Country differences and a mediation model for creative adaptability predicting emotional well-being through creative self-efficacy, resilient coping, and emotion regulation (reappraisal and suppression) were examined. The findings point to slight differences in countries, which are potentially due not only to the culture but also to the phase of the pandemic. More consistently, creative adaptability was positively associated with creative self-efficacy, resilient coping, and reappraisal emotion regulation in all countries. Regarding mediation, in the Israeli, Italian, and Chinese samples, creative adaptability was positively related to resilient coping, which was positively related to emotional well-being. Similar relations were found for creative self-efficacy as a mediator in the United States and Chinese samples. In the Chinese sample, creative adaptability was positively associated with suppression, which was negatively associated with emotional well-being. These results are suggestive of the role of creative adaptability in dealing with the emotional burden associated with the COVID-19 crisis.

abstract = "People have a tendency to position the object facing inward when composing the image, known as the inward bias. Previous research has found that directional cues, such as the gaze direction of the portrait, can influence the inward bias. However, whether and how the facial emotion of the portrait influences the inward bias remains unclear. In the present study, a photo-adjustment task was used to investigate the effect of facial emotion on inward bias and its underlying mechanism using both behavioral and neural measures. Results showed that compared to neutral emotion, happy emotion suppressed the inward bias, as reflected by decreased activation of the superior frontal gyrus during the task. In addition, participants’ self-report data suggested that the suppressive effect of the happy facial emotion may be due to a safer evaluation of the environment. These findings shed light on the mechanism of the inward bias from the perspective of emotional motivation. "

abstract = "Adults differ considerably in their perception of both native and nonnative phonemes. For instance, when presented with continua of native phonemes on two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) or visual analog scaling (VAS) tasks, some people show sudden changes in responses (i.e., steep identification slopes) and others show gradual changes (i.e., shallow identification slopes). Moreover, some adults are more successful than others at learning unfamiliar phonemes. The predictors of these individual differences and the relationships between them are poorly understood. It also remains unclear to what extent different tasks (2AFC vs. VAS) may reflect distinct individual differences in perception. In two experiments, we addressed these questions by examining the relationships between individual differences in performance on native and nonnative phonetic perception tasks. We found that shallow 2AFC identification slopes were not related to shallow VAS identification slopes but were related to inconsistent VAS responses. Additionally, our results suggest that consistent native perception may play a role in promoting successful nonnative perception. These findings help characterize the nature of individual differences in phonetic perception and contribute to our understanding of how to measure such differences. This work also has implications for encouraging successful acquisition of new languages in adulthood."

abstract = "Prior research has shown that visual information, such as a speaker’s perceived race or ethnicity, prompts listeners to expect a specific sociophonetic pattern (“social priming”). Indeed, a picture of an East Asian face may facilitate perception of second language (L2) Mandarin Chinese-accented English but interfere with perception of first language- (L1-) accented English. The present study builds on this line of inquiry, addressing the relationship between social priming effects and implicit racial/ethnic associations for L1- and L2-accented speech. For L1-accented speech, we found no priming effects when comparing White versus East Asian or Latina primes. For L2- (Mandarin Chinese-) accented speech, however, transcription accuracy was slightly better following an East Asian prime than a White prime. Across all experiments, a relationship between performance and individual differences in implicit associations emerged, but in no cases did this relationship interact with the priming manipulation. Ultimately, exploring social priming effects with additional methodological approaches, and in different populations of listeners, will help to determine whether these effects operate differently in the context of L1- and L2-accented speech.

abstract = "Theoretical understanding of first impressions from faces has been closely associated with the proposal that rapid approach–avoidance decisions are needed during social interactions. Nevertheless, experimental work has rarely examined first impressions of people who are actually moving—instead extrapolating from photographic images. In six experiments, we describe the relationship between social attributions (dominance and trustworthiness) and the motion and apparent intent of a perceived person. We first show strong correspondence between judgments of photos and avatars of the same people (Experiment 1). Avatars were rated as more dominant and trustworthy when walking toward the viewer than when stationary (Experiment 2). Furthermore, avatars approaching the viewer were rated as more dominant than those avoiding (walking past) the viewer, or remaining stationary (Experiment 3). Trustworthiness was increased by movement, but not affected by approaching/avoiding paths. Surprisingly, dominance ratings increased both when avatars were approaching and being approached (Experiments 4–6), independently of agency. However, diverging movement (moving backward) reduced dominance ratings—again independently of agency (Experiment 6). These results demonstrate the close link between dominance judgments and approach and show the updatable nature of first impressions—their formation depended on the immediate dynamic context in a more subtle manner than previously suggested."
